# Search Component

Problem Statement:

- When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.

- As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.

- Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.

- Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.

- Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

## Solution

I have used the countries data from:-

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamspruce/search-filter-painate-reactjs/main/data/countries.json
```

And I build the Fronted Part by myself.

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
